      <h2>FAMILY HISTORY</h2>
      <p>Family history holds key information about your past and clues to your future health. By collecting your family's health history, you can learn what health problems you may be at increased risk for in the future and how to reduce your risks. Many of your physical traits (such as eye color, hair color, and height) are inherited. So, too, are risks for certain genetic conditions and health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. You may have noticed that some of your relatives are healthier and live longer than other relatives. You may also have noticed that some relatives have the same health problems. By collecting your family's health history, you can learn what health problems you may be at increased risk for in the future and how to reduce your risks. For instance, people at increased risk for heart disease may be able to reduce their risk through not smoking, regular exercise, and diet.</p>
      </br>
      <p>It is important to note that none of us knows or has access to complete family history information. Some families have little or no access to information. In some families, people remember experiences or diagnoses differently. Each family works with the information available to them. However, many families discover that, often, there are one or more members who are the unofficial historian(s) of the family. This historian can often assist in tracking down information.</p>
      </br>
      <p>Several tools have been developed and are available online to help families get started with medical histories:

      <h2>ADVANCE CARE PLANNING</h2>
      <p style="font-size:14px">Advance care planning is making decisions about the care you would want to receive if you happen to become unable to speak for yourself. These are your decisions to make, regardless of what you choose for your care, and the decisions are based on your personal values, preferences, and discussions with your loved ones.</p>
      </br>
      <p style="font-size:14px">Before you are in an accident or have an illness that leaves you unable to talk about your wishes, you can tell your family, friends and healthcare providers what your wishes and personal beliefs are about continuing or withdrawing medical treatments at the end of life.</p>
      </br>
      <p><b>Advance care planning includes:</b>
          <ul style="width:100%">
            <li style="float:none">Getting information on the types of life-sustaining treatments that are available.</li>
            <li style="float:none">Deciding what types of treatment you would or would not want should you be diagnosed with a life-limiting illness.</li>
            <li style="float:none">Sharing your personal values with your loved ones.</li>

      <p> <b> Getting Started: </b>
        <ul style="width:100%">
          <li style="float:none"> Think about what kind of treatment you do or do not want in a medical emergency. It might help to talk with your doctor about how your present health conditions might influence your health in the future. </li>
          <li style="float:none"> Decide if you want a healthcare proxy, someone like a family member or friend who can have authority over a wide range of decisions or a few specific ones in your medical care. </li>
          <li style="float:none"> Make your wishes known and official with an advance directive that includes a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. </li>
          <li style="float:none"> Give copies of your advance directive to your healthcare proxy and doctor, and review your advance care planning decisions from time to time. </li>

      <h2>HEALTH LITERACY</h2>
      <p>Every day, you make choices about your health: what to eat, when to see a doctor, whether or not to smoke. To stay healthy, you must know how to read the labels on food and medicine, locate the nearest health center,
      report symptoms to health professionals, understand insurance paperwork, and pay medical bills. These can be complicated tasks and the skills to achieve them are not explicitly taught. </p>
      </br>
      <p>Individuals have different levels of health literacy, which refers to how well a person can get the health information and services that they need, and how well they understand them. These differences in health literacy often involve differences in:
          <ul style="width:100%">
            <li style="float:none">Access to information that individuals can understand;</li>
            <li style="float:none">Skills, such as finding that information, communicating with health care providers, living a healthy lifestyle, and managing a disease;</li>
            <li style="float:none">Knowledge of medical words, and of how their healthcare system works;</li>
            <li style="float:none">Abilities, such as physical or mental limitations; and</li>
            <li style="float:none">Personal factors, such as age, education, language abilities, and culture.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      </br>
       <p>Low health literacy can result in medication errors; low rates of treatment compliance due to poor communication between providers and patients; reduced use of preventive services and unnecessary emergency room visits; ineffective management of chronic conditions, due to inadequate self-care skills; longer hospital stays and increased hospital re-admissions; poor responsiveness to public health emergencies; and higher mortality.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p>For those with low health literacy, their ability to make health decisions is affected, which can in turn harm their health.</p>

        <h2>BUILDING A HEALTH CARE TEAM</h2>
        <p> One of the most important challenges of healthcare consumers is the selection of their team of caregivers. Some consumers coordinate, manage, and recruit each member of their family's team of caregivers, or it can be a shared role between a consumer and their provider. These caregivers can include a variety of people. Most teams include medical providers like primary care doctors and specialists as well as community-based support to address the social, emotional, and physical aspects of health, among others. 

        These can include speech therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, teachers, aides, home caregivers, nurses, and/or tutors. Other members might be counselors, psychologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, baby-sitters, grandparents, friends, religious community, and neighbors. </p>
        </br>
        <p> While families look for caregivers that are highly skilled and accessible, they also search for someone with whom they feel the greatest level of comfortable communication. They look for caregivers they can ask any question and to whom they can communicate their needs without embarrassment. Families seek providers that are comfortable learning as well as teaching. They look for providers with whom they can form partnerships. </p>
        </br>
        <p> With so many different knowledge bases and sometimes priorities, members of the team may raise conflicting concerns and recommendations. The family then learns how to weigh all the information, finally choosing what works best for them. One strategy that has worked for many families includes teaming up with other local families. Aside from the benefits of sharing support, these partnerships can help identify areas of concern, encouraging additional resources and expertise within the community.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p> Certainly, no one knows a patient better than his/her family. While doctors and other caregivers may have condition-specific information, only a patient and their family members can determine if and how that information relates to their them. Over time, many families become experts on a diagnosis in the family. Often families take this opportunity to teach their providers what they know. In this way, they become advocates not only for the patient, but also for other patients.

        <h2>BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT</h2>
        <p> Briefly write down significant medical history. Include episodes of major illness, hospital admissions, ongoing medical or behavioral problems, and medications. This summary can help guide the health care team when reviewing the patient's chart.</p>
        </br>
        <p> Make a written list of questions and concerns. Leave space to write down the answers. Meetings with the providers should be an open exchange of ideas and information. Do not hesitate to actively participate. Here are some questions that may be good to ask during an appointment:

              <li style="float:none"> What is the diagnosis? </li>
              <li style="float:none"> How accurate is the diagnosis? </li>
              <li style="float:none"> Are there any tests that can confirm that a person has this condition? </li>
              <li style="float:none"> What are the characteristics of this condition? </li>
              <li style="float:none"> Is there a cure or treatment for the condition? </li>
              <li style="float:none"> Is financial assistance available? </li>

              <li style="float:none"> Where can I get additional information? </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        </br>
          <p> If the diagnosis is known, bring a brief explanation of the diagnosis. If available, bring any brochures or relevant articles. These can serve as reminders of the important health concerns.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p> Bring a list of all the health care professionals involved in the patient's care. Include their names, specialties, and contact information. This can help bring together the team and encourage an integrated approach.

          </br>

          <p> <b> Do not be afraid to ask questions. </b> All questions are important. Sometimes there is a lot going on at the health institution and it may be difficult to remember all the questions.  Bringing a list of questions with room for your notes may be helpful. </p>

          <p> <b> Before leaving the office, make sure that all questions have been answered and you are comfortable with the information presented. </b> If the provider suggested a diagnosis, prescribed medication, or recommended a treatment, do not hesitate to ask questions or raise concerns.

        <h2>ALZHEIMER's DISEASE</h2>
        <p> It is true that some of us get more forgetful as we age. It may take longer to learn new things, remember familiar names and words, or find our glasses. These are usually signs of mild forgetfulness, not serious memory problems. Serious memory problems affect your ability to carry out everyday life activities such as driving a car, shopping, or handling money.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Dementia describes a group of symptoms that are caused by changes in brain function. Dementia symptoms may include asking the same questions repeatedly; becoming lost in familiar places; being unable to follow directions; getting disoriented about time, people, and places; and neglecting personal safety, hygiene, and nutrition. People with dementia lose their abilities at different rates.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        The most common form of dementia among older people is Alzheimer's disease, which initially involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps (amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles) composed of misplaced proteins. Three genes have been discovered that cause early onset (or family) Alzheimer's.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include memory loss, language deterioration, impaired ability to mentally manipulate visual information, poor judgment, confusion, restlessness, and mood swings. Eventually Alzheimer's destroys cognition, personality, and the ability to function. The early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, which include forgetfulness and loss of concentration, are often missed because they resemble natural signs of aging.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease. Age and family history are important known risk factors. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease and no way to slow the progression of the disease. For some people in the early or middle stages of Alzheimer's disease, medication such as tacrine (Cognex) may alleviate some cognitive symptoms. Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may keep some symptoms from becoming worse for a limited time. A fifth drug, memantine (Namenda), was recently approved for use in the United States.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Research has shown that first-degree relatives of African Americans with Alzheimer's disease have a higher cumulative risk of dementia than do those of whites with Alzheimer's disease. However, the additional risk of dementia conferred by being a first-degree relative, by being female, or by the probability of having an APOE genotype, the most common genetic risk factor associated with late-onset Alzheimer's appeared similar in African American and white families.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p> Those with Alzheimer's disease often need some type of chronic care. Chronic care differs from the acute care people receive in hospitals and doctor's offices. Chronic care is characterized by daily personal-care assistance, supervision, help with taking medications, meal preparation, companionship, shopping, cleaning and doing the laundry, for example. Chronic care in America varies from community to community. It includes community-based and institutional care providers as well as state, federal, and private funding sources. Many Alzheimer's patients are served by this system — in their homes, in special “dementia-care” programs, in adult day care facilities and in nursing homes. The health care professionals working in this system are typically social workers, nurses, therapists and case managers.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Once an individual with Alzheimer's disease has lost competence, it is too late to designate the person he or she wants to make his or her health care, financial and estate-planning decisions. This is why choosing a decision-maker in advance of incapacity can be critical to maintaining the quality of life for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease, as well as for his or her family. <a href="#pagetwo">Learn more about advance care planning</a>.

        <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS</h2>
        <p> Exposure to toxic substances can harm the reproductive systems of women and men and make it harder to get pregnant. Developing fetuses, infants, children, pre-teens and teenagers are especially vulnerable. Being exposed to even small amounts of toxic substances during important times of development can lead to disease early in life, later in life, or even across generations.</p>
        </br>
        <p> You can prevent exposure at home, prevent exposure at work, prevent exposure in your community, become a smart consumer, and make the government work for you by following these steps:
          <ul style="width:100%; float:none">
            <li style="float:none"> Don't smoke. </li>
            <li style="float:none"> Use non-toxic products, both in terms of personal care products and those that you use to clean your home. </li>
            <li style="float:none"> Drive less. Carpool, take public transportation, ride your bike, or walk. </li>
            <li style="float:none"> Never burn trash, especially furniture, tires, and plastics. </li>
            <li style="float:none"> Never throw toxic substances down drains or toilets or in the garbage. Examples of toxic substances include car oil, gasoline, pesticides, solvents, and medicines.</li>
            <li style="float:none"> Don't spray bugs. Pesticides are toxic chemicals for killing insects, rodents, weeds, bacteria, and mold. Keep insects and rodents out of your home by cleaning up crumbs and spills, storing food in tightly closed containers, sealing cracks around doors, window sills, and baseboards, and reparing drips and holes.</li>
            <li style="float:none"> Get out your mop. Toxic substances like lead, pesticides, and flame retardants are presant in dust. Sweeping or dusting with a dry cloth can spread the dust in the the air instead or removing it.</li>
            <li style="float:none"> Take off your shoes. Shoes can carry toxic chemicals into your home.</li>
            <li style="float:none"> Don't dry-clean your clothes. Most dry-cleaning systems use a chemical called perchloroethylene (PERC). Dry-cleaned clothes release PERC, polluting the air in your home, so use water instead.</li>
            <li style="float:none"> Pick your plastics carefully. Some plastics release toxic chemicals like vinyl chloride, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA).</li>
            <li style="float:none">Avoid pesticides and other toxic substances in food and water.</li>
            <li style="float:none">Avoid lead exposure and test your home for radon.</li>

        <h2>ASTHMA</h2>
        <p> Asthma is characterized by inflammation of the air passages resulting in the temporary narrowing of the airways that transport air from the nose and mouth to the lungs. Asthma symptoms can be caused by allergens or irritants that are inhaled into the lungs, resulting in inflamed, clogged and constricted airways. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing tightness in the chest. In severe cases, asthma can be deadly. There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment.

        <p> Asthma has a genetic component. If only one parent has asthma, chances are 1 in 3 that each child will have asthma. If both parents have asthma, it is much more likely (7 in 10) that their children will have asthma.

        </br>
        <p> Allergic (extrinsic) asthma is characterized by symptoms that are triggered by an allergic reaction. Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma, affecting over 50% of the 20 million asthma sufferers. It is triggered by inhaled allergens, such as dust mite allergen, pet dander, pollen, and mold, resulting in asthma symptoms. Non­-allergic (intrinsic) asthma is triggered by factors not related to allergies. Like allergic asthma, non­allergic asthma is characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation that is at least partially reversible with medication, however symptoms in this type of asthma are NOT associated with an allergic reaction. Many of the symptoms of allergic and non­allergic asthma are the same (coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or rapid breathing, and chest tightness), but non­allergic asthma is triggered by other factors such as anxiety, stress, exercise, cold air, dry air, hyperventilation, smoke, viruses or other irritants. In non­allergic asthma, the immune system is not involved in the reaction.

        <p> In the United States the burden of asthma falls disproportionately on the black and Hispanic — largely Puerto Rican — populations, and especially on minority children. These groups have disproportionately high rates of poor asthma outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. As much as 40 percent of the risk of asthma in minority children is attributable to exposure to residential allergens that could be reduced, if not eliminated. Access to care is hampered by socioeconomic disparities, shortages of primary care physicians in minority communities, and language and literacy barriers.

      <p> Sneezing, wheezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery, red eyes -- these are just some of the symptoms that more than 35 million Americans face each year as the pollen from trees, grass, flowers, and plants makes its way into the air. For many, relief is just a drugstore counter away -- with a wide array of traditional medications available to help. However, for an increasing number of allergy sufferers the road to relief is best paved by Mother Nature, with a variety of all-natural treatments that studies show can help -- often without many of the troubling side effects ascribed to traditional care.</p>
      </br>
      <p> Among those generating the loudest buzz right now is the European herb butterbur (Petasites hybridus). In one study, published recently in the British Medical Journal, a group of Swiss researchers showed how just one tablet of butterbur four times daily was as effective as a popular antihistamine drug in controlling symptoms of hay fever -- without the traditional symptom of drowsiness that sometimes occurs. In a second study, presented at the 60th annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Allergies Health Center (AAAAI), a group of British researchers put their stamp of approval on butterbur's effectiveness in quelling symptoms of grass allergy. Other herbal supplements proving helpful include freeze-dried nettles and a tonic made from the herb goldenseal, which is recommended to be added to still one more natural treatment -- a saline (salt water) nasal spray.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p> In addition to herbs, many naturopathic doctors also believe certain nutrients can be helpful in quieting seasonal symptoms. Among the most popular are grape seed extract and a flavonoid compound known as quercetin. Although both occur naturally in many foods -- and are especially abundant in red wine -- when used in supplement form they can be extremely helpful in reducing allergy symptoms, particularly in conjunction with vitamin C.
      </p>

      <p> You might want to try cooking up some allergy relief in the form of hot, spicy foods. The reason: Experts say the spicier the dish, the more likely it is to thin mucous secretions, which in turn can clear nasal passages. Among the most frequently recommended spices for this purpose include cayenne pepper, hot ginger, and fenugreek, as well as the traditional onion and garlic.</p>
      </br>
      <p> In addition to whatever natural treatments you try on your own, you may also find significant relief visiting a practitioner of the ancient Chinese medical practice known as acupuncture. Based on the idea that stimulating points outside the body can change or initiate reactions inside, in this case treatment is thought to affect the immune system, where allergic reactions begin. </p>
      </br>
      <p> Though many nontraditional treatments can be extremely helpful, natural doesn't always mean better -- or safer. It's possible to overdose on even the most seemingly mild preparations, and it's important to remember that almost anything in nature's pharmacy could cause a toxic reaction if you use too much. More important is never to mix alternative treatments with traditional drugs without your doctor's approval. </p>

        <h2>DEMENTIA AND MEMORY LOSS</h2>
        <p> It is true that some of us get more forgetful as we age. It may take longer to learn new things, remember familiar names and words, or find our glasses. These are usually signs of mild forgetfulness, not serious memory problems. If you’re worried about your forgetfulness, see your doctor. You also can do many things to help keep your memory sharp. Finding a hobby, spending time with friends, eating well, and exercising may help you stay alert and clear­headed. </p>
        </br>
        <p> Serious memory problems affect your ability to carry out everyday life activities such as driving a car, shopping, or handling money. Dementia describes a group of symptoms that are caused by changes in brain function. Dementia symptoms may include asking the same questions repeatedly; becoming lost in familiar places; being unable to follow directions; getting disoriented about time, people, and places; and neglecting personal safety, hygiene, and nutrition. People with dementia lose their abilities at different rates. </p>
        </br>
        <p> Dementia is caused by many conditions. Some conditions that cause dementia can be reversed, and others cannot. The two most common forms of dementia in older people are Alzheimer's disease and multi­infarct dementia (sometimes called vascular dementia). These types of dementia are irreversible, which means they cannot be cured. (Symptoms associated with dementia can often be treated, however.) </p>
        <p> Sometimes older people have emotional problems that can be mistaken for dementia. Feeling sad, lonely, worried, or bored may be more common for older people facing retirement or coping with the death of a spouse, relative, or friend. Adapting to these changes leaves some people feeling confused or forgetful. Emotional problems can be eased by supportive friends and family, or by professional help from a doctor or therapist.

        <h2>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PREVENTION</h2>
        <p> Asthma is characterized by inflammation of the air passages resulting in the temporary narrowing of the airways that transport air from the nose and mouth to the lungs. Asthma symptoms can be caused by allergens or irritants that are inhaled into the lungs, resulting in inflamed, clogged and constricted airways. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing tightness in the chest. In severe cases, asthma can be deadly. There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Asthma has a genetic component. If only one parent has asthma, chances are 1 in 3 that each child will have asthma. If both parents have asthma, it is much more likely (7 in 10) that their children will have asthma.

Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma, affecting over 50% of the 20 million asthma sufferers. It is triggered by inhaled allergens, such as dust mite allergen, pet dander, pollen, and mold, resulting in asthma symptoms. Non­-allergic (intrinsic) asthma is triggered by factors not related to allergies. Like allergic asthma, non­allergic asthma is characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation that is at least partially reversible with medication, however symptoms in this type of asthma are NOT associated with an allergic reaction. Many of the symptoms of allergic and non­allergic asthma are the same (coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or rapid breathing, and chest tightness), but non­allergic asthma is triggered by other factors such as anxiety, stress, exercise, cold air, dry air, hyperventilation, smoke, viruses or other irritants. In non­allergic asthma, the immune system is not involved in the reaction.

        <p> In the United States the burden of asthma falls disproportionately on the black and Hispanic — largely Puerto Rican — populations, and especially on minority children. These groups have disproportionately high rates of poor asthma outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. As much as 40 percent of the risk of asthma in minority children is attributable to exposure to residential allergens that could be reduced, if not eliminated. Access to care is hampered by socioeconomic disparities, shortages of primary care physicians in minority communities, and language and literacy barriers. A pattern of health care behavior characterized by the underuse of long-term control medications and a reliance on episodic and emergency care is common in black and Hispanic Americans with asthma. Underuse of asthma medicines, especially of long-term control medications like inhaled corticosteroids, is more common in minority than in white children. Underuse of asthma medications can reflect breakdown via: (1) under-prescribing, (2) not filling prescriptions, and (3) poor compliance with filled prescriptions. Increasing the use of long-term control medications is key to reducing disparities in the burden of asthma.

        <p> Menopause refers to the point at which a woman has stopped having menstrual periods. For many women this time of life and the years leading up to menopause are times when they experience new and bothersome symptoms, especially “hot flashes”. Other women may not have any symptoms at all, or at least they don’t seem to notice them. I find that many women have lots of questions about menopause. So here are the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) and what I tell my patients in response to each of these questions. </p>
        </br>
        <h3>How can I tell if I'm in menopause?</h3>
        <p> Menopause is when a woman’s periods have completely stopped. Doctors have defined this as the time when a woman has had no menstrual periods for a whole year. The average age that women in the U.S. reach menopause is 51, and from new studies it seems to be one year earlier in African American women (50). However, there are several additional factors that are known to affect the timing of menopause. Women who are smokers go into menopause earlier and heavy women (obese or overweight) tend to go into menopause later than average. </p>
        </br>
        <h3>What is perimenopause?</h3>
        <p> Perimenopause is the transition (or journey) to menopause. It usually starts about four years before menopause. During perimenopause women often will have more and more irregular periods, hot flashes, problems sleeping, and feel irritable. The irritability can be mostly anxiety, easily getting angry or sometimes mild depression.
        </p>
        <h3>What should a women do if her period “comes back” after she’s been in menopause for awhile?</h3>
        <p>Vaginal bleeding after menopause is called “post-menopausal bleeding.” Any vaginal bleeding after menopause is “abnormal” and needs to be evaluated by your health care provider. The first sign of cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer) is often post-menopausal bleeding, so any bleeding after menopause needs to be checked out carefully. Endometrial cancer is more common in Black women that other women so we need to be very diligent about getting checked out if we have any vaginal bleeding after menopause.</p>

        <h2>What are the symptoms of menopause?</h2>
        <p> The most common symptom is “hot flashes.” It is a feeling of getting hot all over that last usually last for 30 seconds to 10 minutes and sometimes causes the woman to break out in a sweat. When hot flashes happen at night, they almost always cause sweating, so are often described as “night sweats.” About 80% of women have some hot flashes. For women who do have hot flashes, they usually last about 7 years total. However, African American women tend to have hot flashes for longer than other women – an average of 10 years. Women who are heavy – obese or overweight – are also more likely to have hot flashes. There are many other symptoms of menopause. The other common ones are: sleep problems, mood swings or irritability, mild depression, vaginal dryness, decreased interest in sex (low libido), joint achiness, and urinary frequency or leakage. No woman has exactly the same experience. There are many other symptoms that a smaller subset of woman may have. You can learn more about these symptoms and the ones mentioned above on an excellent website called <a href="http://www.34-menopause-symptoms.com/" target="_blank">34 menopause symptoms</a>.</p>

        <h2>What is the treatment for menopause symptoms?</h2>
        <p> The main treatment available by prescription for menopause symptoms is “hormone replacement therapy” also called HRT. This treatment is most effective for hot flashes and vaginal dryness. It is a combination of estrogen (the women’s hormone) and progesterone (another women’s hormone) for women who still have their uterus. Women who have had a hysterectomy can take estrogen alone. The reason that women with a uterus are given progesterone along with estrogen is that estrogen alone can increase the possibility of cancer developing in the lining of the uterus. Most women received HRT for menopause before 2000, but newer research has told us more about the risks of HRT. Besides the risk of uterine cancer, HRT also makes women more likely to get breast cancer or blood clots in their legs. But if hot flashes are bothering you a great deal, you should ask your doctor to prescribe HRT for you, since it has been shown to be safe for most women who take it starting right after menopause for 5 to 7 years. But women with a history of breast cancer, heart disease or blood clots should not take HRT. If you would like read more about this topic, here are two helpful ources of information about hormone replacement therapy, the <a href="http://www.menopause.org/for-women" target="_blank">Menopause Society</a> and the <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/" target="_blank">National Women’s Health Information Center</a>.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p> A few other prescription medicines have been found to help menopausal symptoms especially hot flashes and mood swings. These include several medications which are commonly used for depression and anxiety: venlafaxine, citalopram, and escitalopram.</p>
        </br>
        <p>If the most bothersome symptoms a woman has are vaginal dryness and/or urinary frequency or leakage, an alternative option is estrogen that goes directly into the vagina, such as estrogen cream, tablets or an estrogen ring that only has to be inserted once every three months. These are not absorbed into the rest of the body and are much safer. These are also only by prescription, so talk to your health care provider if you think vaginal estrogen is the right choice for you.</p>

        <h2>Are there natural treatments or remedies that a woman can use to decrease menopause symptoms?</h2>
        <p> There are lots of things that a woman can do to decrease menopausal symptoms naturally. Some of them are very easy. For example, hot flashes can be managed using fans, by taking off a layer of clothing when one occurs, sleeping with fewer bed overs on, and having cool water by the bed to sip throughout the night. Many women also find that they experience less menopausal symptoms when they exercise more often, do yoga, meditate, or practice other relaxation techniques. Hot flashes are increased by drinking alcoholic drinks, so cutting down on alcohol can make a difference. Some women also find that cutting down on coffee makes a difference too.
        </p>
        </br> Several natural supplements which can be purchased at health food stores, pharmacies or supermarkets like Whole Foods are felt to help hot flashes, but there is not solid proof that they help. The ones that are most commonly tried are Black Cohosh and Evening Primrose Oil. Eating soy containing foods also seems to decrease hot flashes.

        <h3>Are there other ways that menopause is different for Black women?</h3>
        <p> While African Americans have more hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and urine leakage than other ethnic groups, they are actually less likely to have some of the bodily symptoms of menopause like headaches, difficulty sleeping, racing heart, stiffness and soreness in joints than women of other races, according to the Black Women’s Health Project. And a Yale study done in 2005 found that Black women are more likely to have unusual symptoms like in body odor, hot feet and bloating.
        </p>
