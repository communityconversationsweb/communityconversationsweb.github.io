          Family history holds key information about your past and clues to your future health. By collecting your family’s health history, you can learn what health problems you may be at increased risk for in the future and how to reduce your risks. Many of your physical traits (such as eye color, hair color, and height) are inherited. So, too, are risks for certain genetic conditions and health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. You may have noticed that some of your relatives are healthier and live longer than other relatives. You may also have noticed that some relatives have the same health problems. By collecting your family’s health history, you can learn what health problems you may be at increased risk for in the future and how to reduce your risks. For instance, people at increased risk for heart disease may be able to reduce their risk through not smoking, regular exercise and diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that none of us knows or has access to complete family history information.  Some families have little or no access to information.  In some families, people remember experiences or diagnoses differently.  Each family works with the information available to them.  However, many families discover that, often, there are one or more members who are the unofficial historian(s) of the family.  This historian can often assist in tracking down information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several tools have been developed and are available on-line to help families get started with gathering medical histories:

          Advance care planning is making decisions about the care you would want to receive if you happen to become unable to speak for yourself. These are your decisions to make, regardless of what you choose for your care, and the decisions are based on your personal values, preferences, and discussions with your loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in an accident or have an illness that leaves you unable to talk about your wishes, who will speak for you? You can tell your family, friends and healthcare providers what your wishes and personal beliefs are about continuing or withdrawing medical treatments at the end of life.
        </p>
        <p> Advance care planning includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Getting information on the types of life-sustaining treatments that are available.</li>
            <li>Deciding what types of treatment you would or would not want should you be diagnosed with a life-limiting illness.</li>
            <li>Sharing your personal values with your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Completing advance directives to put into writing what types of treatment you would or would not want should you be unable to speak for yourself.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <b> Getting Started: </b>
          <ul>
            <li> Think about what kind of treatment you do or do not want in a medical emergency. It might help to talk with your doctor about how your present health conditions might influence your health in the future. </li>
            <li> Decide if you want a healthcare proxy, someone like a family member or friend who can have authority over a wide range of decisions or a few specific ones in your medical care. </li>
            <li> Make your wishes known and official with an advance directive that includes a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. </li>
            <li> Give copies of your advance directive to your healthcare proxy and doctor, and review your advance care planning decisions from time to time. </li>
          </ul>

            Families have told us that a number of activities have helped them reduce the stressful parts of parenting a child with medical or genetic problems. Reducing the stress allows them to make more room for what every family wants: to enjoy their child. Activities include: forming partnerships with their child’s providers and playing an active role in all levels of decision-making, becoming an expert on their child’s concerns and learning to advocate for those concerns, and getting involved with other families with similar or related concerns.

            One of the most important challenges of healthcare consumers is the selection of their team of caregivers. Some consumers coordinate, manage, and recruit each member of their family's team of caregivers. These caregivers can include a variety of people. Most teams include medical providers like primary care doctors and specialist doctors. Often, there are speech therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, teachers, aides, and/or tutors. Other members might be counselors, psychologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, baby-sitters, grandparents, friends, and neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
          While families look for caregivers that are highly skilled and accessible, they also search for someone with whom they feel the greatest level of comfortable communication. They look for caregivers they can ask any question and to whom they can communicate their needs without embarrassment. Families seek providers that are comfortable learning as well as teaching. They look for providers with whom they can form partnerships.
          </p>
          <p> With so many different knowledge bases and sometimes priorities, members of the team may raise conflicting concerns and recommendations. The family then learns how to weigh all the information, finally choosing what works best for them. One strategy that has worked for many families includes teaming up with other local families. Aside from the benefits of sharing support, these partnerships can help identify areas of concern, encouraging additional resources and expertise within the community.
          </p>
          <p> Certainly, no one knows a child better than his/her parents. While doctors and other caregivers may have condition-specific information, only parents can determine if and how that information relates to their child. Over time, many families become experts on their child's diagnosis. Often families take this opportunity to teach their providers what they know. In this way, they become advocates not only for their child, but also for other children.
