        <div class="panel-body"><p><b>Leveling the Playing Field: Community Conversations expands and adapts a well-recognized Barbershop/Salon model long employed in public health.</b> While the Barbershop format supports single session, information-driven lectures, the unidirectional information flow from health providers to consumers does not develop an interconnected community who share information and strategies. Designed to specifically address the broader health needs of Cambridge’s black women and families, our implementation brings together black women consumers with black women providers on common ground and in ongoing conversation. We aim to form a new “health care team” of consumers and faculty and to encourage all participants on this team to recognize, value and honor an array of valid forms of expertise. Knowledge can be trained and lived, quantitative and qualitative, population-wide and family-specific.</p></br>
        <p><b>Our Approach:</b>Our approach, while covering disease processes, focuses on promoting health and wellbeing. The agenda includes practical care issues, prevention strategies, associated risks and co-morbidities, disparities in access to health care/health resources, and heritability. Specific health challenges are placed in context, allowing our consumers to develop a deeper and more holistic picture of how to work toward health and wellbeing. While up-to-date health information is exchanged at each conversation, the initiative strives to provide each participant with a variety of strategies and tools to create an individualized health scaffolding while developing critical health literacy skills. These skills to evaluate the validity, relevance, and applicability of health information require becoming familiar with health related language and concepts and critical assessing health information gleaned from our sessions, the media, medical journal articles (provided at each session), and shared by their personal health care practitioners. </p></br>
        <p><We believe that this emphasis on a shared role as the “keepers” of important health information and medical decision-making has the potential to reduce some barriers to improved access to and uptake of health care resources. </br>

Our community participants often share that they don’t have time and space to consider their own health needs—that they rank low on their own priority lists—there are too many other people that they need to care for first. Recognizing that women often serve as the stewards of family health, we believe that the benefits of our efforts have been felt much more broadly. Exploring the stresses of balancing the variety of needs and demands placed on women’s shoulders, CC helps women internalize that in order to fulfill their role of Chief of Family Health, they too must preserve their own health.
